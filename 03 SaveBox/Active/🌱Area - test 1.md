### 3. My Yearly Schedule:







___
> [!example] ### Instructions:

### Step 1 – Breakdown Your Area into Wishes
A **Wish** is something that would make you happy if you reached it, but you don’t fully control the outcome.   Think of it as the _byproduct_ of your Goals.
Use your Wishes as motivation. They remind you why your Goals matter and keep you going.

Follow this structure to write your Goal:  
  **Measurable result + timeframe**

**Examples:**
- Lose 5 kg in 3 months  
- Run a half marathon starting in 3 months  
- Improve sleep quality within 8 weeks

#### Need ideas?

Ask AI:

 “In the area *‘{{from link name}}’*, suggest realistic and meaningful wishes people like me could aim for.  
 Follow this structure:  
 Result + measurable state + timeframe.  
 Example:  
 - Lose 5 kg in 3 months  
 - Run a half marathon by May 2025  
 - Improve sleep quality within 8 weeks”

 *(Note: AI responses are general suggestions. Always adjust them to fit your own life and values.)*
