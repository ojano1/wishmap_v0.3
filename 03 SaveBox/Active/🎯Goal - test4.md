### Step 1 – Breakdown Your Wish into Goals
A **Goal** is a controllable action that, once completed, makes it almost impossible for your Wish not to come true.  

Follow this structure to write your Goal:  
**Action + measurable outcome + timeframe**

**Examples:**
- Launch 10 products in 4 months  
- Build an email list of 1,000 subscribers in 3 months
