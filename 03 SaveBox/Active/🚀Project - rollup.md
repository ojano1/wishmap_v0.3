### My Project
- [ ] 🚀Project - rollup

This page is for one concrete deliverable that supports your Goal.  
Now break it down into **Tasks** and **Habits** — small, trackable actions you can complete and review.

---

## Step 1 – List Your Tasks

List one-time actions you can finish in about an hour.  
Use links with the prefix `task `.

Use this structure:  
**Action + duration (≤1h)**

**Examples:**
- [[task – Write Product Outline (1h)]]  
- [[task – Record 3 Demo Clips (45m)]]

### ✍️ My Tasks
- [[task – ]]
- [[📌Task - job 1]]
- [[📌Task - job 2]]
[[🎯Goal - rollup]]

## Step 2 – List Your Habits

List repeatable actions that build consistency.  
Use links with the prefix `habit `.

Use this structure:  
**Activity + frequency pattern**

**Examples:**
- [[habit – Morning Run]] → *daily* (default)  
- [[habit – Run Monday]] → *weekly on Monday*  
- [[habit – Run Mon Thu]] → *weekly on Monday and Thursday*  
- [[habit – Workout 1st]] → *monthly on the 1st*  

### ✍️ My Habits
- [[habit – ]]

### Need ideas?

Ask AI:

> “I’m a *[age / role / life stage]* working on the project *‘{{from link name}}’* under my goal *‘{{parent goal name}}’*.  
> Suggest clear, 1-hour tasks and repeatable habits that would move this project forward.  
> Follow these patterns:  
> - Task – Action + duration (≤1h)  
> - Habit – Activity + frequency pattern (daily, weekly, or monthly).  
> Example:  
> - Task – Write product outline (1h)  
> - Habit – Morning run (daily)  
> - Habit – Run Monday (weekly on Monday)  
> - Habit – Workout 1st (monthly on the 1st)”
>
> *(Note: AI responses are general suggestions. Always adjust them to fit your own life and values.)*

## Step 3 – Click Your Task and Habit Links

Create your Task and Habit notes by clicking the links above, and continue building from there.

### Keep in mind
- Start with one Project.  
- Complete the full chain once — **Project → Task/Habit**.  
- After that, add and link freely. You’ll know how it fits.
