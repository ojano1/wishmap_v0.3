### My Goal
- [ ] {{title}}

Break this **Goal** into concrete **Projects** you can complete.  
Each Project represents a clear deliverable that moves you closer to your Goal — think of them as milestones.

---

## Step 1 – List Your Projects

Use this structure to write each Project:  
**Deliverable + scope + time frame**

**Examples:**
- Build Product MVP in 4 weeks  
- Create Email Launch Sequence within 6 weeks  
- Design Pricing Page by the end of the month  

### ✍️ My Projects
*Use links to create each Project page (prefix: `project `).*
- [[project – ]]
-

### Need ideas?

Ask AI:

> “I’m a *[age / role / life stage]* working toward the goal *‘{{from link name}}’* under my wish *‘{{parent wish name}}’*.  
> Suggest realistic projects I could complete to achieve this goal.  
> Follow this structure:  
> Deliverable + scope + time frame.  
> Example:  
> - Build product MVP in 4 weeks  
> - Create 5-email launch sequence within 6 weeks  
> - Design pricing page by the end of the month”
>
> *(Note: AI responses are general suggestions. Always adjust them to fit your own life and values.)*

## Step 2 – Click Your Project Links

Create your Project notes by clicking the links above, and continue building from there.

### Keep in mind
- Start with one Project.  
- Complete the full chain once — **Project → Task**.  
- After that, add and link freely. You’ll know how it fits.
