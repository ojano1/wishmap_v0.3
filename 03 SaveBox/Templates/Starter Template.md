# 🏁 MindMap OS – Start Here

Welcome.  
This is your base map. Here you’ll define the key areas of your life and connect them to what you want to do next.  
Everything you add starts from here and stays linked — nothing gets lost.

## How It Works

MindMap OS lets you build from two directions.

### Top-Down  
Start with the big picture.  
List your **Areas**, set a **Goal**, shape a **Project**, and break it into **Tasks**.  
This guided path helps you learn the structure and see how pieces connect.  
It’s the best way to start.

### Bottom-Up  
Once you’ve built your first chain, capture thoughts as they come.  
Drop quick notes or links anywhere — even half-formed ones.  
They’ll show up automatically in your **Daily page’s Inbox**, ready for review and linking later.  
Nothing disappears, even if it’s raw or unfinished.

You're free to work top-down, bottom-up, or mix both as your needs change. The system will adapt to your flow.

## Step 1 – List Your Areas

Write your main life areas below.  Use short, clear names.  

### ✍️ My Areas
 *Use links to create each wish page (prefix: `area `).*
- [[area – ]]
-

### Need ideas?

If you’re unsure where to begin, try this AI prompt:

> “I’m a *[age / gender / role / life stage]* who works as *[job / field]*.  
> What life areas do people like me often focus on improving, and why do they matter?”

*(Note: AI responses are general suggestions. Always adjust them to fit your own life and values.)*

(Example ideas: Fitness, Finances, Family, Learning, Creativity.)

## Step 2– Click Your Area Links
Create your Area notes by clicking the link, and continue your work from there.

### Keep in mind
- Start with one Area.  
- Complete the full chain once — Area → Wish → Goal → Project → Task.  
- After that, add and link freely. You’ll know how it fits.
