I am promoting my obsidian plugin, WishMap. Its a system that let user map their plan from area-wish-goal-project-task. It present the chain in tree diagram for better visualization and evaluation before committing. Then it allow user to schedule the task from bird eye view by yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily. It's low learning curve, user just need to know how to link a file. Its not rigid, they can choose to jump the chain or start anywhere. Wishmap also has a habit tracker graph in 30day grid for pattern recognition, consistancy percentage. And also a plot graph of habit and outcome in the same graph to see if there is simple correlation between habit and result.

Fatures:
- Time duration rollup to see how long to reach a goal
- Top-down chain tree diagram for easy visualize the plan in big picture from wish to micro tasks
- Low learning curve, just need to know how to link.
- All in one plugin, no need to diy your system with multiple plugins.
- Habit tracker, daily, weekly, Certain day(s) in a week with heatmap for pettern analysis and consistency percentage, plus habit vs result plot to see correlation.
- Fleet note for Quick capture ideas 
- Visualize tasks by impact following 80-20 rule
- AI prompt ideas included to help break brain freeze and act faster
- for goal pursuer and life maintainer.
- Budget roll up from task to project to goal


Who is it for:
- for working hustlers to stay out of procrastination and new shiny object chaser
- for parent to educate their kids about project planning from early age(low learning curve)
- for proffesionals planning for career rank up
- For stable people who want to keep standard of their life.
I need your help to build the plugin. I will send you my dev data in 3 batches and we proceed from there. Wait till you get all the data, don't code anything yet.
