## 1. Overview

WishMap tracks three active types for scheduling:  
**Goal**, **Project**, and **Task.**

Scheduling is flexible.  
Users can plan top-down (year ‚Üí day) or bottom-up (task ‚Üí goal).  
The system keeps both paths synchronized automatically.

---

## 2. Prompt System

|Level|Trigger|Type|Placement|Purpose|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Goal**|No `targetYear`|Soft prompt|Sidebar banner|Suggest committing this goal to a year.|
|**Project**|Has parent goal with year, no `targetQuarter`|Soft prompt|Sidebar banner|Suggest assigning quarter.|
|**Task**|No `due`|Hard prompt|Inline, under checkbox|Request due date or week assignment. Also checks if parent has tags.|

**Behavior**

- Soft prompts can be ignored.
- Hard prompts require a decision (set due date or skip).
- Prompts update live as metadata changes.
- Sidebar always shows count of unscheduled items.
---
## 3. Prompt Logic Flow

`onNoteOpen(note):
  if type == goal and !targetYear:
      showSoftPrompt("Schedule this goal for a year?")
  if type == project and parentHasYear(note) and !targetQuarter:
      showSoftPrompt("Assign a quarter?")
  if type == task and !due:
      checkParents()
      showHardPrompt("Set due date or week.")

---

## 4. Parent Check + Auto-Fill (Bottom-Up Inference)

When user sets a due date, the system **infers and fills** missing period tags for the task and its ancestors.

**Derived Fields**

|Field|Source|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`targetWeek`|ISO week from `due`|2025-W12|
|`targetMonth`|Month of `due`|2025-03|
|`targetQuarter`|Month ‚Üí quarter|2025-Q1|
|`targetYear`|Year of `due`|2025|

**Propagation Upward**

- Task ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Goal
- Any missing field gets filled.
- Existing manual tags are preserved.
- Conflicts are flagged, not overwritten.

---

## 5. Top-Down Inheritance

If user schedules a parent first:

- Projects inherit parent‚Äôs `targetYear` and `targetQuarter`.
- Tasks inherit `targetQuarter` and `targetMonth`.
- User can override any value manually.

---

## 6. Conflict Handling

|Case|Action|
|---|---|
|Parent=2024, Child=2025|Flag with ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ÄúMismatch with parent‚Äù|
|Partial tags (goal has year only)|Fill missing quarter/month automatically|
|Multiple parents|Use nearest valid ancestor|
|Recurring task|Apply only to generated instances|

---

## 7. Auto-Fill Rules

`onDueSet(task):
  derive period tags from due
  for each ancestor:
    if tag missing:
      fill derived value
  mark derived tags as (auto)
  show toast: "Tags auto-filled from due date. [Undo]"
`

Manual edit removes the ‚Äúauto‚Äù mark.

---

## 8. Data Integrity

- Every scheduled node ends with a complete timeline:

`targetYear
targetQuarter
targetMonth
targetWeek
due
`
- Ensures all nodes appear correctly in the **Time Tree** view.
- Keeps rollups consistent for duration and budget.

---

## 9. User Experience Summary

|Action|System Response|
|---|---|
|Create goal|Prompt to assign year|
|Create project|Prompt to assign quarter|
|Create task|Prompt to set due date|
|Set due date|Auto-fill all missing parent tags|
|Edit parent tags|Children inherit updated tags|
|Ignore prompts|No enforcement, optional scheduling|
|Jump steps (goal ‚Üí task)|Still works, inference fills gaps|

## 10. Key Principles

1. **Non-linear freedom:** Any order of creation allowed.
2. **Auto-coherence:** Missing tags always resolved.
3. **Minimal friction:** Prompts are context-aware, never blocking.
4. **Bidirectional sync:** Tags propagate top-down and bottom-up.
5. **Transparency:** Auto tags visible and reversible.


## **Phase 1 ‚Äì Build solid base (must work before visuals)**

### **1. Metadata scanner**

Goal: detect and index all relevant notes (goal, project, task).

- Read frontmatter and inline YAML keys.
- Record: file path, type, parent links, period tags, done state.
- Save to an in-memory index (`wishmap.index`).

**Why first:** every later feature (prompts, rollups, tree, scheduler) depends on accurate data.

---

### **2. Inference engine**

Implements your new scheduling logic:

- **Top-down inheritance** and **bottom-up propagation**.
- Auto-fill missing tags.
- Mark auto-filled tags.
- Flag conflicts.

This runs after each scan or metadata change.

---

### **3. Prompt system**

After index + inference are stable, attach to `onNoteOpen`.

- Check type and tags.
- Show soft or hard prompt according to rule set (v1.0).
- Hard prompt opens date picker or drag board.

Keep prompts plain first, then refine UX later.

---

## **Phase 2 ‚Äì Visualization**

### **4. Tree rework**

Upgrade your current mapping tree to pull data from the new index.  
Add chips for time tags (Year, Qtr, Month, Week).

### **5. Time tree prototype**

Reuse the same renderer.  
Group nodes by year ‚Üí quarter ‚Üí month ‚Üí week ‚Üí day.  
Show both structural and time tags for each node.

---

## **Phase 3 ‚Äì Scheduling UI**

### **6. Commit / Drag board**

- Kanban-style panel for assigning period tags.
- Context-aware filters (unscheduled goals, projects, tasks).
- Drag updates tags instantly in frontmatter.
    

---

## **Phase 4 ‚Äì Maintenance and performance**

### **7. Cache + diff**

- Persist small JSON cache for index data.
- Only rescan changed files.

### **8. Rollups**

- Reconnect duration, budget, and completion rollups to new index.
    

---

## **Recommended order to code**

1. Metadata scanner ‚Üí test with console log of all nodes.
2. Inference engine ‚Üí verify tags propagate correctly.
3. Prompt logic ‚Üí show inline and sidebar prompts.
4. Update Tree ‚Üí display tags next to links.
5. Build Time Tree ‚Üí verify all nodes appear correctly.
6. Add drag board ‚Üí confirm tag writing works.

New requirwment:

On wish page, make kanban like 4 column of dinamic quarter, yyyy-Q1 - yyyy-Q4. Theyear display depan on today's date. Make it possible that the goals listed can be dragged into one of the columns. Based on colimn selection, update the goal's tag according to its Quarter column.

On goal page, make 12  dinamic rows of month names. If children tasks has no due date,  Make the project **listed** draggable to that row and apply the month tag yyyy-01 - yyyy-12.  Title the rows same as the tags. Adjjuat the year according to created  date. So the month before the ctrated date will be labeled the next year. If the childern task already have due date, auto assign the project following the earliest due among the children. Ig nore children with no due. When children has due date, dim the rows and disable dragging . When due date change, remove old project tag and apply new month tag.
When a project assigned a month tag, assign a year tag to the parwnt: goal. If the goal has children projects, apply the earliest year. 


### New Requirement

Make a new page called Time tree with the same style of wishmap tree. The new page consists of 12 month dynamic folders with name format: yyyy-01 Jan til yyyy-12 Dec. Sort it to the earliest year with respect to today's date. Aside to that, there are 2 more folders:  Unscheduled and Overdue. 

If a project has child task with due dates, rewrite the project's due date following the latest due of child task. Put projects inside a month folder according to it's due date. Put ‚ö†Ô∏è emoji next to the project who still has child task with no due date. Remove when all tasks have due date. 

Projects has default due date same as created date.

### Area page
On area page under H3  ### 3. My Yearly Schedule:, make 2 dynamic year columns named yyyy starting from today's year. Under the H3 ### ‚úçÔ∏èMy Wishes: user will type wish links. If the wish link pages are realized and have year tags, move the wish links into the respective year column. If the wish link pages are created and don't have year tags yet, put emoji ‚ö†Ô∏è next to the link. Let user drag the wish with emoji ‚ö†Ô∏è into those columns and assign year tag with a name same as the column's name. List the wishes from other areas that has year tag in the respective column names. If user drag a wish from one column to another, update the year tag and remove all the tags under that are from wishes, goals, projects, and tasks, also reset the task due date empty.   

### Wish page
On wish page under H3  ### üìÖMy Quarterly Schedule:, make 4 dynamic quarter columns named yyyy-Q1 - yyyy-q4. If the wish has a quarter tag, sort with that quarter first. Else, sort on today's quarter first (no expired quarters). Under the H3 ### üéØMy Goals, user will type goal links. If the goals link page are realized and have quarter tag, move the goals into the quarter column accordingly. If the goals link page are created and don't have quarter tags yet, put emoji ‚ö†Ô∏è next to the goal name link. Let user drag the goals with emoji ‚ö†Ô∏è into those columns and assign quarter tag with a name same as the column's name. List the wishes from other areas that has quarter tag in the respective column names. 

### Goal page
On goal page, make 4 dynamic quarter tabs named yyyy-Q1 til yyyy-Q4. If goal has a quarter tag, sort the tabs with the goal's quarter tag first. If not, sort by today's quarter first. Under each tab, make 3  month columns named yyyy-xx - yyyy-xx where xx is month number of that quarter.  Grey out and deactivate the expired months(can not be dragged into or out from).
If the goal has a quarter tag, make that quarter tab active. If not, make today's quarter active. Under the H3 ### üöÄMy Projects, user will type project  links. If that project link page is created and have month tag same as the column's name, move that project from that H3 list into the column. If the project link is created and has no month tag yet, put emoji ‚ö†Ô∏è next to the link. Let user drag the  ‚ö†Ô∏è project into the columns and assign a month tag according to that column. If the user open a different quarter tab than the goal's quarter tag and drag projects from H3 section into the month column of that quarter tab, force apply the month tag of that project according to the column of choice. If the children project falls in 2 quarters, or all projects fall in a different quarter than the parent goal's quarter tag,update the parent goal quarter tag according to the latest month tag of the children project. If user drag a project from a column to another, update the project's month tag to the new column. Update the goal parent quarter tab if needed, and reset empty the children task's due date.

### Project page
On project page, make 3 dynamic month tabs named yyyy-xx where xx is the month number. If the project has a month tag, sort the tabs by that month tag first. If not, sort by today's month  first. Under the tab, make 4 columns of week names yyyy-Wxx. Grey out and deactivate the expired weeks (can not be dragged into or out from).
If the project has a month tag, make that month tab active. If not, make today's month tab active. Under the H3 ### üìåMy Tasks, user will type task  links. If that task link page is created and have week tag same as the column's name, move that task from that H3 list into the column. If the task link is created and has no week tag yet, put emoji ‚ö† next to the link. Let user drag the  ‚ö† task into the columns and assign a week tag according to that column. If the user open a different month tab than the project's  month tag and drag tasks from H3 section into the week column of that month tab, force apply the week tag of that task according to the column of choice. If the children task falls in 2 months, or all tasks fall in a different month than the parent project's month tag, update the parent project's month tag according to the latest week tag of the children task. If user drag a task from a column to another, update the task's week tag to the new column. Update the project parent month tab if needed, and reset empty the task's due date.

### Task page
On task page, make 4 dynamic week tabs named yyyy-Wxx where xx is the week number. If the task has a week tag, sort the tabs by that week tag first. If not, sort by today's week first. Under the tabs, make 7 columns of day names from Monday to Sunday. Grey out and deactivate the expired day's dates (can not be dragged into).
If the task has a week tag, make that week tab active. If not, make today's date week tab active. Under the H3 ### üìåSame Project Tasks,  list all the tasks with the same project parent. Display the week tag next to the task's link name.

If that task link page is created and has a due date,  move that task from that H3 list into that respective date's day column.

If the task link is created and has no week tag yet, put emoji ‚ö† next to the link. Let user drag the  ‚ö† task into one of the columns and assign a week tag according to that column. If the user open a different month tab than the project's  month tag and drag tasks from H3 section into the week column of that month tab, force apply the week tag of that task according to the column of choice. Also update the parent project month tag. If the children task falls within 2 month names, or all tasks fall in a different month than the parent project's month tag, update the parent project's month tag according to the latest week tag of the children task. If user drag a task from a column to another, update the task's week tag to the new column's name. Update the project parent month tab if needed, and reset empty the task's due date.

If the task
